Purpose
-------
Great RESTful APIs look like they were designed by a single team. This promotes API adoption, reduces friction, and enables clients to use them properly. To build APIs that meet this standard, and to answer many common questions encountered along the way of RESTful API development. We have shared it with you to inspire additional discussion and refinement within and among your teams, and contribute our learnings and suggestions to the tech community at large.

Usage
-----
Feel free to use these guidelines as a guidance for your own development. Note that we encourage our own teams to use them in order to challenge their APIs. As such, you should consider this to be a living, evolving document. We will revise and update based on our learnings and experiences.
