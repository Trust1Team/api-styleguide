## {{ book.should }} Reducing Bandwidth Needs and Improving Responsiveness

APIs should support techniques for reducing bandwidth based on client needs. This holds for APIs
that (might) have high payloads and/or are used in high-traffic scenarios like the public Internet
and telecommunication networks. Typical examples are APIs used by mobile web app clients with
(often) less bandwidth connectivity. ('Mobile First' company, be mindful of this
point.)

Common techniques include:

* gzip compression
* querying field filters to retrieve a subset of resource attributes (see [*Support Filtering of Resource Fields*](../performance/Performance.md#should-support-filtering-of-resource-fields)
below)
* paginate lists of data items (see [*Pagination*](../pagination/Pagination.md) below)
* `ETag` (and If-[None-]Match) headers to avoid refetch of unchanged resources
* pagination for incremental access of larger (result) lists

Each of these items is described in greater detail below.

## {{ book.should }} gzip Compression

Compress the payload of your API’s responses with gzip, unless there’s a good reason not
to — for example,  you are serving so many requests that the time to compress becomes a bottleneck.
This helps to transport data faster over the network (fewer bytes) and makes frontends respond faster.

Though gzip compression might be the default choice for server payload, the server should also support payload without compression and its client control via Accept-Encoding request header -- see also [RFC 7231 Section 5.3.4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.4). The server should indicate used gzip
compression via the Content-Encoding header.

## {{ book.should }} Support Filtering of Resource Fields

Depending on your use case and payload size, you can significantly reduce network bandwidth need by supporting filtering of returned entity fields. Here, the client can determine the subset of fields he wants to receive via the fields query parameter — example see [Google AppEngine API's partial response](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/rest/performance#partial-response):

### Unfiltered

```http
GET http://api.example.org/resources/123 HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/x.person+json

{
  "id": "cddd5e44-dae0-11e5-8c01-63ed66ab2da5",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington, DC, United States",
  "birthday": "1984-09-13",
  "partner": {
    "id": "1fb43648-dae1-11e5-aa01-1fbc3abb1cd0",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington, DC, United States",
    "birthday": "1988-04-07"
  }
}
```

### Filtered

```http
GET http://api.example.org/resources/123?fields=(name,partner(name)) HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/x.person+json;fields=(name,partner(name))

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "partner": {
    "name": "Jane Doe"
  }
}
```

Other approaches we have considered are JSONPath or GraphQL. While they have advantages, neither of
them can easily be plugged into an existing serialization process, so they require an additional,
manual serialization process, whereas the above solution addresses our main filter use cases and
can easily be introduced with a minimum of effort.

Hint: OpenAPI doesn't allow you to formally specify whether depending on a given parameter will
return different parts of the specified result schema. Explain this in English in the parameter
description.

## {{ book.could }} Support the ETag Header

If a resource changes, the contents of the [`ETag`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) header
must also change. Combined with the `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` headers, the `ETag` header allows
caching of entities.

Its possible contents:

* the entity’s version number
* hash of the response body
* hash of the entity’s last modified field
